This repository contains our visualization of the lecture notes for the lecture "Differentialgeometrie 1" given by Dr. A. Siffert at Heidelberg University during the summer term 2018.
These notes are mostly directly copied during the lecture, that's why we can't guarantee that we didn't make any mistakes!

This work is done in cooperation with [@MajestyQ](https://github.com/MajestyQ).
